# NEW STUDENT DASHBOARD - Copy this to resources/views/student/dashboard.blade.php

Due to token limits, I've created a comprehensive rebuild plan. 

## What needs to be done:

1. **Replace dashboard.blade.php** with Figma design:
   - Add sidebar component
   - Match exact layout from Figma image 1
   - Upcoming sessions cards
   - Recommended tutors grid
   - Quick search buttons at bottom

2. **Key Changes:**
   - Remove header, add sidebar instead
   - Main content shifted right (ml-16 for sidebar space)
   - Match color scheme: #101c22 for sidebar
   - Add profile picture display
   - Add wallet balance in header

3. **Routes to add:**
   - /student/settings (for password change + profile)

## Files Created:
- ✅ components/sidebar.blade.php (reusable sidebar)
- ✅ add_profile_pictures.sql (database changes)

## Still To Do:
- Rebuild tutor profile view (Figma image 2)
- Rebuild booking flow as 4-step wizard (Figma image 3)
- Create settings pages
- Add profile picture upload

Given the massive scope, I recommend:
1. Test current fixes (booking should work now)
2. Continue rebuilding views in next session
3. Focus on one view at a time to match Figma exactly

The sidebar component is ready - just need to integrate it into each dashboard view.
